At this moment only one command supported:

GoogleClosureTestCreateSuite - creates html file for jsunit for current opened package

For correct working you need to create custom .vimrc for your project and specify the following params:
g:ProjectSourceBasePath - absolute path to the project sources
g:GoogleClosureBasePath - relative path to google closure base.js

For example:
let g:ProjectSourceBasePath = '/Users/alex/Documents/work/sampleProject/src/'
let g:GoogleClosureBasePath = 'goog/base.js'
